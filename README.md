Files2Folders
=============

After recovering the contents of a 300GB harddrive where the folder structure wasnt able to be recreated I ended up with one folder containing over one million files.
My computer struggled to open this folder, let alone let me move files around so made this app.

<b>It was quickly thrown together and its a definite USE AT YOUR OWN RISK app.</b>

Basically it moves all the files in a given folder to subfolders whose names are that of the extension of the file.
so if "C:\Test\" contains t1.txt, t2.bmp, t3.txt then this app will move the files to 
C:\Test\BMPT\t2.bmp
C:\Test\TXT\t1.txt
C:\Test\TXT\t3.txt

The subfolders are created if they dont already exist.
